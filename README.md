Simon Game

A web-based memory game inspired by the classic Simon. Players must listen to a sequence of tones and lights and repeat them in the correct order. The sequence gets progressively longer and faster with each successful round!
🎮 How to Play

    Start the Game: Press any key on your keyboard to begin.

    Watch & Listen: The game will flash a button and play a corresponding sound.

    Repeat: Click the buttons in the exact order they were shown.

    Level Up: If you get the sequence right, the game adds a new step to the pattern.

    Game Over: If you click the wrong button, the screen will flash red, a "wrong" sound will play, and you'll have to press a key to restart.
